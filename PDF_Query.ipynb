       " Document(page_content='(9) As long as a signif icant number of the Union’s international partners have policy approach es that do not achi eve the \\nsame level of climat e ambition, there is a risk of carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs if, for reasons of costs related \\nto climat e policies, businesses in certain industr y sectors or subsectors transfe r production to other countr ies or \\nimp orts from those countr ies replace equivalent products that are less intensi ve in term s of greenhouse \\ngas emissions. Such situations could lead to an increase in the total global emissions, thus jeopardising the \\nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions that is urgently needed if the world is to keep the increase in global averag e \\ntemperature to well below 2 °C abov e pre-industr ial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to \\n1,5 °C abov e pre-industr ial levels. As the Union increases its climat e ambition, that risk of carbon leakage could \\nunder mine the effectiveness of Union emission reduction policies.\\n(10) The initiative for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (the ‘CBAM’) is part of the ‘Fit for 55’ legislative packa ge. \\nThe CBAM is to serve as an essential element of the Union’s toolbox for meeting the objective of a climat e-neutral \\nUnion at the latest by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement by addressing the risk of carbon leakage that results \\nfrom the Union’s increased climate ambition. The CBAM is expecte d to also contr ibute to promoting \\ndecarbonisation in third countr ies.\\n(11) Existing mechanisms for addressing the risk of carbon leakage in sectors or subsect ors where such risk exists consist \\nof the transitional free allocation of EU ETS allowa nces and financial measures to compensat e for indirect emission \\ncosts incur red from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electr icity prices. Those mec hanisms are set out in \\nArticle 10a(6) and Article 10b of Directive 2003/87/EC, respectively . The free allocation of EU ETS allowances at \\nthe level of best performers has been a policy instr ument for certain industr ial sectors to address the risk of carbon \\nleakage. However , compared to full auctioning, such free allocation weakens the price signal that the system \\nprovid es and thus affects the incentives for investment into further reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\\n(12) The CBAM seeks to replace those existing mec hanisms by addressing the risk of carbon leakage in a different way, \\nnamely by ensur ing equivalent carbon pricing for imports and domestic products. To ensure a gradual transition \\nfrom the current system of free allowances to the CBAM, the CBAM should be progressively phased in while free \\nallowa nces in sector s covered by the CBAM are phased out. The combined and transitional application of EU ETS \\nallowa nces allocat ed free of charge and of the CBAM should in no case result in more favour able treatment for \\nUnion goods compared to goods impor ted into the customs territory of the Union.\\n(13) The carbon price is rising, and compan ies need long-t erm visibility , predictability and legal certainty to mak e their \\ndecisions on investment in the decarbonisation of industr ial processes. Theref ore, in order to strengthen the legal \\nframewor k for fighting carbon leakage, a clear pathwa y for gradual further exte nsion of the scope of the CBAM to \\nproducts, sectors and subsect ors at risk of carbon leakage should be established.\\n(14) While the objective of the CBAM is to prevent the risk of carbon leakage, this Regulation would also encourag e \\nproducers from third countr ies to use technologies that are more efficient in reducing greenhouse gases so that \\nfewer emissions are generat ed. For that reason, the CBAM is expecte d to effectively suppor t the reduction of \\ngreenhouse gas emissions in third countr ies.\\n(15) As an instr ument to prevent carbon leakage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the CBAM should ensure that \\nimp orted products are subject to a regulatory system that applies carbon costs equivalent to those borne under the \\nEU ETS, resulting in a carbon price that is equivalent for impor ts and domestic products. The CBAM is a climate \\nmeasure which should suppor t the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the risk of carbon \\nleakage, while ensur ing compatib ility with World Trade Org anization law.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 130/54 16.5.2023  ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\CBAM.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(16) This Regulation should apply to goods imported into the customs territory of the Union from third countr ies, excep t \\nwhere their production has already been subject to the EU ETS through its application to third countr ies or \\nterritories or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS.\\n(17) With a view to ensur ing that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy is continuously accompan ied by economic \\nand social cohesion, account should be take n, upon future revision of this Regulation, of the special charact eristics \\nand constraints of the outermost regions refer red to in Article 349 TFEU as well as of island States whic h are part of \\nthe customs territory of the Union, without under mining the integrit y and coherence of the Union lega l order , \\nincluding the internal mark et and common policies.\\n(18) With a view to preventing the risk of carbon leakage in offshore installations, this Regulation should apply to goods, \\nor processed products from those goods resulting from an inward processing procedure, that are brought to an \\nartificial island, a fixed or floating structure, or any other structure on the continental shelf or in the exclusive \\neconomic zone of a Member State where that continental shelf or excl usive economic zone is adjacent to the \\ncustoms territory of the Union. Imp lementing powers should be conferr ed on the Commission to lay down detailed \\nconditions for the application of the CBAM to such goods.\\n(19) The greenhouse gas emissions that should be subject to the CBAM should correspond to those greenhouse gas \\nemissions covered by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC, namely carbon dioxide (‘CO 2’) as well as, where relevant, \\nnitrous oxide and perf luorocarbons. The CBAM should initially apply to direct emissions of those greenhouse gases \\nfrom the time of production of goods until the impor t of those goods into the customs territory of the Union, \\nmirroring the scope of the EU ETS to ensure coherence. The CBAM should also apply to indirect emissions. Those \\nindirect emissions are the emissions arising from the generation of electr icity used to produce the goods to which \\nthis Regulation applies. The inclusion of indirect emissions would further enhance the environmental effectiveness \\nof the CBAM and its ambition to contr ibut e to figh ting climat e change. Indirect emissions should, howe ver, not be \\ntaken into account initially for the goods in respect of which financial measures apply in the Union that compen sate \\nfor indirect emissions costs incur red from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electr icity prices. Those goods \\nare identif ied in Annex II to this Regulation. Future revisions of the EU ETS in Directive 2003/87/EC and, in \\nparticular , revisions of the compensation measures of the indirect costs should be appropr iately reflected as regards \\nthe scope of application of the CBAM. Dur ing the transitional period, data should be collect ed for the purpose of \\nfurther specifying the methodology for the calculation of indirect emissions. That methodology should take into \\naccount the quantity of electr icity used for the production of the goods liste d in Annex I to this Regulation, as well \\nas the countr y of origin, generation source, and the emission factors relat ed to that electr icity . The specifi c \\nmethodology should be further specifi ed in order to achieve the most appropr iate way to prevent carbon leakage \\nand ensure the environmental integr ity of the CBAM.\\n(20) The EU ETS and the CBAM share a common objective of pricing greenhouse gas emissions embedded in the same \\nsector s and goods through the use of specific allowa nces or certificates. Both syste ms have a regulatory nature and \\nare justified by the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the binding environmental target under \\nUnion law, set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, to reduce the Union’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least \\n55 % compare d to 1990 levels by 2030 and the objective to reac h economy-wide climat e neutrality at the latest by \\n2050.\\n(21) While the EU ETS sets the total number of allowa nces issued (the ‘cap’) on the greenhouse gas emissions from \\nactivities within its scope and allows trading of allowances (the ‘cap and trade system’) , the CBAM should not \\nestablish quantitative limits on impor ts, so that trade flows are not restr icted. Moreo ver, while the EU ETS applies to \\ninstallations in the Union, the CBAM should apply to certain goods impor ted into the customs territory of the \\nUnion.\\n(22) The CBAM system has some specific features when compared to the EU ETS, including with respect to the \\ncalculation of the price of CBAM certificates, the possibilities to trade CBAM certificates and their period of validity . \\nThose features are due to the need to preser ve the effectiveness of the CBAM as a measure to prevent carbon leakage \\nover time. They also ensure that the management of the CBAM system is not excess ively burdensome, both in term s EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.5.2023 L 130/55  ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\CBAM.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='of oblig ations imposed on operat ors and administrative resources, while at the same time preser ving a level of \\nflexibility available to operat ors equivalent to that under the EU ETS. Ensur ing such a balance is of particular \\nimp ortance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) concer ned.\\n(23) In order to preser ve its effectiveness as a measure to prevent carbon leakage, the CBAM needs to reflect closely the \\nEU ETS price. While on the EU ETS mark et the price of allowa nces released onto the mark et is determined through \\nauctions, the price of CBAM certificates should reasonably reflect the price of such auctions through averages \\ncalculat ed on a weekly basis. Such weekly average prices reflect closely the price fluctuations of the EU ETS and \\nallow a reasonable margin for importers to take advantage of the price chang es of the EU ETS while also ensur ing \\nthat the system remains manag eable for administrative author ities.\\n(24) Under the EU ETS, the cap determi nes the supply of emission allowances and provid es certainty about maximum \\nemissions of greenhouse gases. The carbon price is determined by the balance of that supply against the mark et \\ndemand. Scarcity is necessar y for there to be a price incentive. This Regulation is not intended to impose a cap on \\nthe number of CBAM certificates available to impor ters; if importers were able to carry forward and trade CBAM \\ncertificates, that ability could have resulted in situations where the price for CBAM certificates would no long er \\nreflect the evolution of the price in the EU ETS. Such a situation would weaken the incentive for decarbonisation, \\nfavouring carbon leakage and impair ing the overarc hing climate objective of the CBAM. It could also result in \\ndiffer ent prices for operat ors from diffe rent countr ies. The limits on the possibilities to trade CBAM certificates and \\nto carry them forward are theref ore justif ied by the need to avoid under mining the effectiveness and climat e \\nobjective of the CBAM and to ensure even-handed treatment of operat ors from differ ent countr ies. However , in \\norder to preser ve the possibility for imp orters to optimise their costs, this Regulation should provide for a system \\nwhere author ities can repurchase a certain amount of excess certificates from importers. Such amount should be set \\nat a level whic h allows a reasonable margin for importers to leverage their costs over the period of validity of the \\ncertificates while preser ving the overall price transmission effect, ensur ing that the environmental objective of the \\nCBAM is preser ved.\\n(25) Given that the CBAM would apply to imports of goods into the customs territory of the Union rather than to \\ninstallations, certain adaptations and simplifications would also need to apply in the CBAM. One such \\nsimplification should be the introduction of a simple and accessible declarative syste m whereby importers repor t \\nthe total verified greenhouse gas emissions embedded in goods impor ted in a given calendar year . A differ ent timing \\ncompare d to the compliance cycle of the EU ETS should also be applied to avoid any poten tial bottleneck that might \\nresult from oblig ations for accredit ed verifiers under this Regulation and Directive 2003/87/EC.\\n(26) Member States should impose penalties for infringements of this Regulation and ensure that such penalties are \\nenforced. More specifically , the penalty amount for the failure of an author ised CBAM declarant to surrender CBAM \\ncertificates should be identical to the amount pursuant to Article 16(3) and (4) of Directive 2003/87/EC. However , \\nwhere the goods have been introduced into the Union by a person other than an author ised CBAM declarant \\nwithout complying with the obligations under this Regulation, the amount of those penalties should be higher in \\norder to be effective, propor tionate and dissuasive, also taking into account the fact that such person is not oblig ed \\nto surrender CBAM certificates. The imposition of penalties under this Regulation is without prejudice to penalties \\nthat may be imposed under Union or national law for the infringement of other relevant oblig ations, in particular \\nthose relat ed to customs rules.\\n(27) While the EU ETS applies to certain production processes and activities, the CBAM should target the corresponding \\nimp orts of goods. That requires clearly identifying imported goods by means of their classification in the Combined \\nNomenclature (‘CN’) set out in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (9)and linking them to embedded emissions.\\n(9)Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Cust oms Tariff \\n(OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 130/56 16.5.2023  ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\CBAM.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(28) The goods or processed products covered by the CBAM should reflect the activities covered by the EU ETS as that \\nsystem is based on quantitative and qualitative criteria linked to the environmental objective of \\nDirective 2003/87/EC and is the most compreh ensive greenhouse gas emissions regulatory system in the Union.\\n(29) Defi ning the scope of the CBAM in a way that reflects the activities covered by the EU ETS would also contr ibute to \\nensur ing that imported products are grant ed a treatment that is not less favour able than that accorded to like \\nproducts of domestic origin.\\n(30) Whilst the ultimat e objective of the CBAM is one of broad product coverag e, it would be prudent to start with a \\nselecte d number of sector s with relatively homog eneous goods where there is a risk of carbon leakage. Union \\nsector s deemed to be at risk of carbon leakage are listed in Commission Delegat ed Decision (EU) 2019/708 (10).\\n(31) The goods, to whic h this Regulation should apply , should be selected after careful analysis of their relevance in term s \\nof cumulated greenhouse gas emissions and risk of carbon leakage in the corresponding EU ETS sector s, while \\nlimiting compl exity and administrative burden on the operators concer ned. In particular , the selection should take \\ninto account basic mater ials and basic products covered by the EU ETS with the objective of ensur ing that emissions \\nembedded in emission-intensive products imported into the Union are subject to a carbon price that is equivalent to \\nthat applied to Union products, and of mitig ating the risk of carbon leakage. The relevant criteria to narrow the \\nselection should be: first, relevance of sectors in terms of emissions, namely whether the sector is one of the largest \\naggregat e emitters of greenhouse gas emissions; second, the sector ’s exposure to signif icant risk of carbon leakage, \\nas defined pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC; and third, the need to balance broad product coverage in term s of \\ngreenhouse gas emissions, while limiting complexity and administrative burden.\\n(32) The use of the first criterion would allow the listing of the following industr ial sector s in terms of cumulated \\nemissions: iron and steel, refiner ies, cement, aluminium, organic basic chemicals, hydrogen and fertilisers.\\n(33) Certain sectors listed in Delega ted Decision (EU) 2019/708 should not, however , be addressed in this Regulation at \\nthis stage, due to their particular charact eristics.\\n(34) In particular , organic chemicals should not be included in the scope of this Regulation due to technical limitations \\nthat at the time of the adoptio n of this Regulation do not allow to define clearly the embedded emissions of such \\nimp orted goods. For those goods the applicable benc hmark under the EU ETS is a basic paramet er, which does not \\nallow for an unambiguous allocation of emissions embedded in individual imported goods. A more target ed \\nallocation to organic chemicals requires more data and analysis.\\n(35) Similar technical constraints apply to refiner y products, for which it is not possible to unambiguously assign \\ngreenhouse gas emissions to individual output products. At the same time, the relevant benchmark in the EU ETS \\ndoes not directly relate to specifi c products, such as petrol, diesel or kerosene, but to all refiner y output.\\n(36) Aluminium products should be included in the CBAM as they are highly exposed to carbon leakage. Moreover , in \\nseveral industr ial applications they are in direct competiti on with steel products because of charact eristics which \\nclosely resemble those of steel products.\\n(37) At the time of the adoptio n of this Regulation, imports of hydrog en into the Union are relatively low. However , that \\nsituation is expected to change signif icantly in the coming years as the Union’s ‘Fit for 55’ packag e promot es the use \\nof renewable hydrog en. For the decarbonisation of industr y as a whole, the demand for renewable hydrog en will \\nincrease, and consequently lead to non-integrat ed production processes in down stream products where hydrog en is \\na precursor . The inclusion of hydrogen in the scope of the CBAM is the appropr iate means to further foster the \\ndecarbonisation of hydrogen.\\n(10)Commission Delegat ed Decision (EU) 2019/708 of 15 Febr uary 2019 supplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European \\nParliament and of the Council concer ning the deter mination of sectors and subsectors deemed at risk of carbon leakage for the period \\n2021 to 2030 (OJ L 120, 8.5.2019, p. 20).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.5.2023 L 130/57  ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\CBAM.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='(9) As long as a signif icant number of the Union’s international partners have policy approach es that do not achi eve the \\nsame level of climat e ambition, there is a risk of carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs if, for reasons of costs related \\nto climat e policies, businesses in certain industr y sectors or subsectors transfe r production to other countr ies or \\nimp orts from those countr ies replace equivalent products that are less intensi ve in term s of greenhouse \\ngas emissions. Such situations could lead to an increase in the total global emissions, thus jeopardising the \\nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions that is urgently needed if the world is to keep the increase in global averag e \\ntemperature to well below 2 °C abov e pre-industr ial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to \\n1,5 °C abov e pre-industr ial levels. As the Union increases its climat e ambition, that risk of carbon leakage could \\nunder mine the effectiveness of Union emission reduction policies.\\n(10) The initiative for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (the ‘CBAM’) is part of the ‘Fit for 55’ legislative packa ge. \\nThe CBAM is to serve as an essential element of the Union’s toolbox for meeting the objective of a climat e-neutral \\nUnion at the latest by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement by addressing the risk of carbon leakage that results \\nfrom the Union’s increased climate ambition. The CBAM is expecte d to also contr ibute to promoting \\ndecarbonisation in third countr ies.\\n(11) Existing mechanisms for addressing the risk of carbon leakage in sectors or subsect ors where such risk exists consist \\nof the transitional free allocation of EU ETS allowa nces and financial measures to compensat e for indirect emission \\ncosts incur red from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electr icity prices. Those mec hanisms are set out in \\nArticle 10a(6) and Article 10b of Directive 2003/87/EC, respectively . The free allocation of EU ETS allowances at \\nthe level of best performers has been a policy instr ument for certain industr ial sectors to address the risk of carbon \\nleakage. However , compared to full auctioning, such free allocation weakens the price signal that the system \\nprovid es and thus affects the incentives for investment into further reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\\n(12) The CBAM seeks to replace those existing mec hanisms by addressing the risk of carbon leakage in a different way, \\nnamely by ensur ing equivalent carbon pricing for imports and domestic products. To ensure a gradual transition \\nfrom the current system of free allowances to the CBAM, the CBAM should be progressively phased in while free \\nallowa nces in sector s covered by the CBAM are phased out. The combined and transitional application of EU ETS \\nallowa nces allocat ed free of charge and of the CBAM should in no case result in more favour able treatment for \\nUnion goods compared to goods impor ted into the customs territory of the Union.\\n(13) The carbon price is rising, and compan ies need long-t erm visibility , predictability and legal certainty to mak e their \\ndecisions on investment in the decarbonisation of industr ial processes. Theref ore, in order to strengthen the legal \\nframewor k for fighting carbon leakage, a clear pathwa y for gradual further exte nsion of the scope of the CBAM to \\nproducts, sectors and subsect ors at risk of carbon leakage should be established.\\n(14) While the objective of the CBAM is to prevent the risk of carbon leakage, this Regulation would also encourag e \\nproducers from third countr ies to use technologies that are more efficient in reducing greenhouse gases so that \\nfewer emissions are generat ed. For that reason, the CBAM is expecte d to effectively suppor t the reduction of \\ngreenhouse gas emissions in third countr ies.\\n(15) As an instr ument to prevent carbon leakage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the CBAM should ensure that \\nimp orted products are subject to a regulatory system that applies carbon costs equivalent to those borne under the \\nEU ETS, resulting in a carbon price that is equivalent for impor ts and domestic products. The CBAM is a climate \\nmeasure which should suppor t the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the risk of carbon \\nleakage, while ensur ing compatib ility with World Trade Org anization law.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 130/54 16.5.2023  ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\CBAM.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(16) This Regulation should apply to goods imported into the customs territory of the Union from third countr ies, excep t \\nwhere their production has already been subject to the EU ETS through its application to third countr ies or \\nterritories or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS.\\n(17) With a view to ensur ing that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy is continuously accompan ied by economic \\nand social cohesion, account should be take n, upon future revision of this Regulation, of the special charact eristics \\nand constraints of the outermost regions refer red to in Article 349 TFEU as well as of island States whic h are part of \\nthe customs territory of the Union, without under mining the integrit y and coherence of the Union lega l order , \\nincluding the internal mark et and common policies.\\n(18) With a view to preventing the risk of carbon leakage in offshore installations, this Regulation should apply to goods, \\nor processed products from those goods resulting from an inward processing procedure, that are brought to an \\nartificial island, a fixed or floating structure, or any other structure on the continental shelf or in the exclusive \\neconomic zone of a Member State where that continental shelf or excl usive economic zone is adjacent to the \\ncustoms territory of the Union. Imp lementing powers should be conferr ed on the Commission to lay down detailed \\nconditions for the application of the CBAM to such goods.\\n(19) The greenhouse gas emissions that should be subject to the CBAM should correspond to those greenhouse gas \\nemissions covered by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC, namely carbon dioxide (‘CO 2’) as well as, where relevant, \\nnitrous oxide and perf luorocarbons. The CBAM should initially apply to direct emissions of those greenhouse gases \\nfrom the time of production of goods until the impor t of those goods into the customs territory of the Union, \\nmirroring the scope of the EU ETS to ensure coherence. The CBAM should also apply to indirect emissions. Those \\nindirect emissions are the emissions arising from the generation of electr icity used to produce the goods to which \\nthis Regulation applies. The inclusion of indirect emissions would further enhance the environmental effectiveness \\nof the CBAM and its ambition to contr ibut e to figh ting climat e change. Indirect emissions should, howe ver, not be \\ntaken into account initially for the goods in respect of which financial measures apply in the Union that compen sate \\nfor indirect emissions costs incur red from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electr icity prices. Those goods \\nare identif ied in Annex II to this Regulation. Future revisions of the EU ETS in Directive 2003/87/EC and, in \\nparticular , revisions of the compensation measures of the indirect costs should be appropr iately reflected as regards \\nthe scope of application of the CBAM. Dur ing the transitional period, data should be collect ed for the purpose of \\nfurther specifying the methodology for the calculation of indirect emissions. That methodology should take into \\naccount the quantity of electr icity used for the production of the goods liste d in Annex I to this Regulation, as well \\nas the countr y of origin, generation source, and the emission factors relat ed to that electr icity . The specifi c \\nmethodology should be further specifi ed in order to achieve the most appropr iate way to prevent carbon leakage \\nand ensure the environmental integr ity of the CBAM.\\n(20) The EU ETS and the CBAM share a common objective of pricing greenhouse gas emissions embedded in the same \\nsector s and goods through the use of specific allowa nces or certificates. Both syste ms have a regulatory nature and \\nare justified by the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the binding environmental target under \\nUnion law, set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, to reduce the Union’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least \\n55 % compare d to 1990 levels by 2030 and the objective to reac h economy-wide climat e neutrality at the latest by \\n2050.\\n(21) While the EU ETS sets the total number of allowa nces issued (the ‘cap’) on the greenhouse gas emissions from \\nactivities within its scope and allows trading of allowances (the ‘cap and trade system’) , the CBAM should not \\nestablish quantitative limits on impor ts, so that trade flows are not restr icted. Moreo ver, while the EU ETS applies to \\ninstallations in the Union, the CBAM should apply to certain goods impor ted into the customs territory of the \\nUnion.\\n(22) The CBAM system has some specific features when compared to the EU ETS, including with respect to the \\ncalculation of the price of CBAM certificates, the possibilities to trade CBAM certificates and their period of validity . \\nThose features are due to the need to preser ve the effectiveness of the CBAM as a measure to prevent carbon leakage \\nover time. They also ensure that the management of the CBAM system is not excess ively burdensome, both in term s EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.5.2023 L 130/55  ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\CBAM.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='of oblig ations imposed on operat ors and administrative resources, while at the same time preser ving a level of \\nflexibility available to operat ors equivalent to that under the EU ETS. Ensur ing such a balance is of particular \\nimp ortance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) concer ned.\\n(23) In order to preser ve its effectiveness as a measure to prevent carbon leakage, the CBAM needs to reflect closely the \\nEU ETS price. While on the EU ETS mark et the price of allowa nces released onto the mark et is determined through \\nauctions, the price of CBAM certificates should reasonably reflect the price of such auctions through averages \\ncalculat ed on a weekly basis. Such weekly average prices reflect closely the price fluctuations of the EU ETS and \\nallow a reasonable margin for importers to take advantage of the price chang es of the EU ETS while also ensur ing \\nthat the system remains manag eable for administrative author ities.\\n(24) Under the EU ETS, the cap determi nes the supply of emission allowances and provid es certainty about maximum \\nemissions of greenhouse gases. The carbon price is determined by the balance of that supply against the mark et \\ndemand. Scarcity is necessar y for there to be a price incentive. This Regulation is not intended to impose a cap on \\nthe number of CBAM certificates available to impor ters; if importers were able to carry forward and trade CBAM \\ncertificates, that ability could have resulted in situations where the price for CBAM certificates would no long er \\nreflect the evolution of the price in the EU ETS. Such a situation would weaken the incentive for decarbonisation, \\nfavouring carbon leakage and impair ing the overarc hing climate objective of the CBAM. It could also result in \\ndiffer ent prices for operat ors from diffe rent countr ies. The limits on the possibilities to trade CBAM certificates and \\nto carry them forward are theref ore justif ied by the need to avoid under mining the effectiveness and climat e \\nobjective of the CBAM and to ensure even-handed treatment of operat ors from differ ent countr ies. However , in \\norder to preser ve the possibility for imp orters to optimise their costs, this Regulation should provide for a system \\nwhere author ities can repurchase a certain amount of excess certificates from importers. Such amount should be set \\nat a level whic h allows a reasonable margin for importers to leverage their costs over the period of validity of the \\ncertificates while preser ving the overall price transmission effect, ensur ing that the environmental objective of the \\nCBAM is preser ved.\\n(25) Given that the CBAM would apply to imports of goods into the customs territory of the Union rather than to \\ninstallations, certain adaptations and simplifications would also need to apply in the CBAM. One such \\nsimplification should be the introduction of a simple and accessible declarative syste m whereby importers repor t \\nthe total verified greenhouse gas emissions embedded in goods impor ted in a given calendar year . A differ ent timing \\ncompare d to the compliance cycle of the EU ETS should also be applied to avoid any poten tial bottleneck that might \\nresult from oblig ations for accredit ed verifiers under this Regulation and Directive 2003/87/EC.\\n(26) Member States should impose penalties for infringements of this Regulation and ensure that such penalties are \\nenforced. More specifically , the penalty amount for the failure of an author ised CBAM declarant to surrender CBAM \\ncertificates should be identical to the amount pursuant to Article 16(3) and (4) of Directive 2003/87/EC. However , \\nwhere the goods have been introduced into the Union by a person other than an author ised CBAM declarant \\nwithout complying with the obligations under this Regulation, the amount of those penalties should be higher in \\norder to be effective, propor tionate and dissuasive, also taking into account the fact that such person is not oblig ed \\nto surrender CBAM certificates. The imposition of penalties under this Regulation is without prejudice to penalties \\nthat may be imposed under Union or national law for the infringement of other relevant oblig ations, in particular \\nthose relat ed to customs rules.\\n(27) While the EU ETS applies to certain production processes and activities, the CBAM should target the corresponding \\nimp orts of goods. That requires clearly identifying imported goods by means of their classification in the Combined \\nNomenclature (‘CN’) set out in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (9)and linking them to embedded emissions.\\n(9)Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Cust oms Tariff \\n(OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 130/56 16.5.2023  ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\CBAM.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

The relevant criteria to narrow the \\nselection should be: first, relevance of sectors in terms of emissions, namely whether the sector is one of the largest \\naggregat e emitters of greenhouse gas emissions; second, the sector ’s exposure to signif icant risk of carbon leakage, \\nas defined pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC; and third, the need to balance broad product coverage in term s of \\ngreenhouse gas emissions, while limiting complexity and administrative burden.\\n(32) The use of the first criterion would allow the listing of the following industr ial sector s in terms of cumulated \\nemissions: iron and steel, refiner ies, cement, aluminium, organic basic chemicals, hydrogen and fertilisers.\\n(33) Certain sectors listed in Delega ted Decision (EU) 2019/708 should not, however , be addressed in this Regulation at \\nthis stage, due to their particular charact eristics.\\n(34) In particular , organic chemicals should not be included in the scope of this Regulation due to technical limitations \\nthat at the time of the adoptio n of this Regulation do not allow to define clearly the embedded emissions of such \\nimp orted goods. For those goods the applicable benc hmark under the EU ETS is a basic paramet er, which does not \\nallow for an unambiguous allocation of emissions embedded in individual imported goods. A more target ed \\nallocation to organic chemicals requires more data and analysis.\\n(35) Similar technical constraints apply to refiner y products, for which it is not possible to unambiguously assign \\ngreenhouse gas emissions to individual output products. At the same time, the relevant benchmark in the EU ETS \\ndoes not directly relate to specifi c products, such as petrol, diesel or kerosene, but to all refiner y output.\\n(36) Aluminium products should be included in the CBAM as they are highly exposed to carbon leakage. Moreover , in \\nseveral industr ial applications they are in direct competiti on with steel products because of charact eristics which \\nclosely resemble those of steel products.\\n(37) At the time of the adoptio n of this Regulation, imports of hydrog en into the Union are relatively low. However , that \\nsituation is expected to change signif icantly in the coming years as the Union’s ‘Fit for 55’ packag e promot es the use \\nof renewable hydrog en. For the decarbonisation of industr y as a whole, the demand for renewable hydrog en will \\nincrease, and consequently lead to non-integrat ed production processes in down stream products where hydrog en is \\na precursor . The inclusion of hydrogen in the scope of the CBAM is the appropr iate means to further foster the \\ndecarbonisation of hydrogen.\\n(10)Commission Delegat ed Decision (EU) 2019/708 of 15 Febr uary 2019 supplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European \\nParliament and of the Council concer ning the deter mination of sectors and subsectors deemed at risk of carbon leakage for the period \\n2021 to 2030 (OJ L 120, 8.5.2019, p. 20).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.5.2023 L 130/57  ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\CBAM.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='(38) Similarly , certain products should be included in the scope of the CBAM despite their low level of embedded \\nemissions occur ring during their production process, as their exclusion would increase the likelihood of \\ncircum venting the inclusion of steel products in the CBAM by modifying the patt ern of trade towards down stream \\nproducts.\\n(39) Conv ersely , this Regulation should not initially apply to certain products the production of whic h does not entail \\nmeaningful emissions such as ferrous scrap, some ferro-allo ys and certain fertilisers.\\n(40) The importation of electr icity should be included in the scope of this Regulation, as that sector is responsible for \\n30 % of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the Union. The Union’s increased climate ambition would widen the \\ngap in carbon costs between electr icity production within the Union and third countr ies. That gap, combined with \\nthe progress in connecting the Union electr icity grid to that of its neighbours, would increase the risk of carbon \\nleakage due to the increase in imports of electr icity , a signif icant part of which is produced by coal-f ired power \\nplants.\\n(41) In order to avoid excessive administrative burden as regar ds compet ent national administrations and importers, it is \\nappropr iate to specify the limited cases in whic h the oblig ations under this Regulation should not apply . That de \\nminimis provision, however , is without prejudice to a continued application of the provis ions under Union or \\nnational law that are necessar y to ensure compl iance with the oblig ations under this Regulation as well as, in \\nparticular , with customs legislation, including the prevention of fraud.\\n(42) As importers of goods covered by this Regulation should not have to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation at \\nthe time of imp ortation, specifi c administrative measures should be applied to ensure that such oblig ations are \\nfulfilled at a later stage. Theref ore, importers should only be entitled to import goods that are subject to this \\nRegulation after they have been granted an author isation by compet ent author ities.\\n(43) The customs author ities should not allow the importation of goods by any person other than an author ised CBAM \\ndeclarant. In accordance with Articles 46 and 48 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and \\nof the Council (11), the customs author ities are entitled to carry out chec ks on the goods, including with respect to \\nthe identification of the author ised CBAM declarant, the eight-digit CN code, the quantity and the countr y of origin \\nof the imported goods, the date of declaration and the customs procedure. The Commission should include the risks \\nrelating to the CBAM in the establishment of the common risk criteria and standards pursuant to Article 50 of \\nRegulation (EU) No 952/2013.\\n(44) Dur ing a transitional period, the custom s author ities should inform customs declarants of the oblig ation to repor t \\ninformation, so as to contr ibut e to the gather ing of information as well as to awar eness on the need to request the \\nstatus of author ised CBAM declarants where applicable. Such information should be communicated by the customs \\nauthor ities in an appropr iate manner to ensure that customs declarants are made aware of such obligation.\\n(45) The CBAM should be based on a declarative system in which an author ised CBAM declarant, who could represent \\nmore than one importer, would submit annually a declaration of the embedded emissions in the goods imported \\ninto the custom s territory of the Union and would surrender the number of CBAM certificates whic h correspond to \\nthose declared emissions. The first CBAM declaration, in respect of the calendar year 2026, should be submitted by \\n31 May 2027 .\\n(46) An author ised CBAM declarant should be allowe d to claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be \\nsurrendered corresponding to the carbon price already effectively paid in the countr y of origin for the declared \\nembedded emissions.\\n(11)Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Cust oms \\nCode (OJ L 269, 10.10.2013, p. 1).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 130/58 16.5.2023  ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\CBAM.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

An \\noperat or should be able to choose that its name, address and contact information in the CBAM registr y are not \\nmade accessible to the public.\\n(49) CBAM certificates would differ from EU ETS allowances for whic h daily auctioning is an essential feature. The need \\nto set a clear price for CBAM certificates would make daily publication excess ively burdensome and confusing for \\noperat ors, as daily prices risk becoming obsolete upon publication. Thus, the publication of CBAM prices on a \\nweekly basis would more accurate ly reflect the pricing trend of EU ETS allowances released onto the mark et and \\npursue the same climat e objective. The calculation of the price of CBAM certificates should theref ore be set on the \\nbasis of a long er timeframe, namely on a weekly basis, than on the timeframe established by the EU ETS, namely on \\na daily basis. The Commission should be task ed with calculating and publishing that average price.\\n(50) In order to give author ised CBAM declarants flexibility in compl ying with their obligations under this Regulation \\nand allow them to benefit from fluctuations in the price of EU ETS allowances, CBAM certificates should be valid \\nfor a limited period of time from the date of their purchas e. The author ised CBAM declarant should be allowed to \\nre-sell a portion of the certificates bought in excess . With a view to surrender ing CBAM certificates, the author ised \\nCBAM declarant should accumulate the number of certificates required during the year whic h corresponds with the \\nthresholds set at the end of each quar ter.\\n(51) The physical characteri stics of electr icity as a product justify a slightly differ ent design within the CBAM as compare d \\nto other goods. Default values should be used under clearly specifi ed conditions, and it should be possible for \\nauthor ised CBAM declarants to claim the calculation of their obligations under this Regulation based on actual \\nemissions. Electr icity trade is different from trade in other goods, in particular because it is traded through \\ninter connected electr icity grids, using power exchanges and specific forms of trading. Mark et coupling is a densely \\nregulated form of electr icity trade which enables the aggreg ation of bids and offers across the Union.\\n(52) To avoid the risk of circum vention and impro ve the traceability of actual CO2 emissions from impor t of electr icity \\nand its use in goods, the calculation of actual emissions should only be permitted under certain strict conditions. In \\nparticular , it should be necessar y to demonstrate a firm nomination of the allocated interconnection capacity and \\nthat there is a direct contractual relation between the purch aser and the producer of the renewable electr icity , or \\nbetween the purchas er and the producer of electr icity having lower than default value emissions.\\n(53) To reduce the risk of carbon leakage, the Commission should take action to address practices of circum vention.

Integration of third countr ies into the Union electr icity market also contr ibutes to the \\nsecur ity of electr icity supplies in those countr ies and in the neighbour ing Member State s.\\n(56) Once the electr icity mark ets of third countr ies are closely integrated into that of the Union through mark et coupling, \\ntechnical solutions should be found to ensure the application of the CBAM to electr icity expor ted from those \\ncountr ies into the customs territory of the Union. If technical solutions cannot be found, third countr ies whose \\nmark ets are coupled with that of the Union should benefit from a time-limited exem ption from the CBAM \\nuntil 2030 with regar d solely to the expor t of electr icity , provided that certain conditions are met. Those third \\ncountr ies should, however , develop a roadmap and commit to implementing a carbon pricing mec hanism \\nprovid ing for a price that is equivalent to the EU ETS, and should commit to achieving carbon neutrality at the latest \\nby 2050 as well as to align with Union legislation in the areas of environment, climat e, competition and energy .
