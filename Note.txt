This code demonstrates how to create a document processing and question-answering system using several Python libraries including openai, langchain, pinecone, and dotenv. Here's a breakdown of its main components and functionalities:

Library Imports: The code begins by importing necessary libraries. openai is used for accessing OpenAI's APIs (like GPT-3), langchain provides tools for working with language models, and pinecone is for vector database operations. The dotenv library is used to load environment variables.

Environment Variables: The .env file is loaded to securely access environment variables like the OpenAI API key.

Reading PDF Documents:

read_doc function: It takes a directory path and uses PyPDFDirectoryLoader from langchain to load PDF documents from that directory.
Chunking Data:

chunk_data function: This splits the text of the documents into smaller chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. This is useful for processing large documents in parts.
Creating Embeddings:

Embeddings are created using OpenAI's language model. The API key is fetched from the environment variables, and embeddings are generated for a given query.
Pinecone Vector Database Initialization:

Initializes a Pinecone database with a specific API key and environment. This database is used for storing and retrieving vector embeddings.
Indexing Documents:

The documents are indexed in the Pinecone database for later retrieval.
Cosine Similarity & Retrieval Function:

retrive_query: A function to retrieve similar documents from the Pinecone database based on cosine similarity. It returns the top k similar documents for a given query.
Question Answering with Langchain:

A question-answering chain is loaded using langchain. This chain uses an OpenAI model (text-davinci-003) to process and answer questions.
Retrieving Answers:

retrive_answers: This function first retrieves relevant documents based on a query, then uses the question-answering chain to generate an answer from these documents.
Executing the Question-Answering System:

Finally, the system is put to use. A query is defined, and the retrive_answers function is called to get the answer to this query.
